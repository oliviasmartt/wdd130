      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Create a website that allows people like me to resell their own clothes. The website is a shopping website, but with one key difference - it allows you to upload your own used clothes and accessories for resale. This websiteâ€™s main goal is to make it easier and more efficient for people to get rid of their previously used items and be able to gain some money from it. You can curate individualized shops for each user, allowing customers to peruse through various personal closets. With my website, people can save money, be reminded of the sustainability of clothes by reducing overstock and help them find treasure and exclusive items. Are you ready to join us in revolutionizing the way we shop?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience </h3>
      <p>Anybody who loves affordable clothes or likes to make easy money</p>  <!-- change this -->
