    <h2> Olivia Smart</h2>
    <p>My name is Olivia Smart but I go by Livi for short. I grew up in
    Southern California in a city called Rancho Cucamonga. It is about an hour
away from the beach so surfing is one of my favorite things to do. I was recently
 married about 6 months ago in the Redlands Temple. My major is software engineering
and after I graduate my husand and I areplanning to move to Hawaii. </p>
<p>Growing up in Southern California was super fun. I never realized how much I 
was taking for granted the nice weather year round. Although I miss the warmer weather 
I love Idaho and it is nice to be around people who share the same beliefs as me. </p>
